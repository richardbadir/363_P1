#1. Basic Select with Simple Where Clause
SELECT * FROM Tracks WHERE Duration > 240;


#2. Basic Select with Simple Group By Clause

#With Group By:
SELECT ReleaseDate, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfTracks FROM Tracks GROUP BY ReleaseDate;

#With Group By and Having Clause:
SELECT ReleaseDate, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfTracks FROM Tracks GROUP BY ReleaseDate HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;



#3. Simple Join Select Query

#Using Product and Where Clause:
SELECT Tracks.*, ContentRating.contentRatingName
FROM Tracks
JOIN TrackContentRating ON Tracks.TrackID = TrackContentRating.TrackID
JOIN ContentRating ON TrackContentRating.contentRatingID = ContentRating.contentRatingID
WHERE ContentRating.contentRatingName = 'EXPLICIT';


SELECT Tracks.*, ContentRating.contentRatingName
FROM Tracks
JOIN TrackContentRating ON Tracks.TrackID = TrackContentRating.TrackID
JOIN ContentRating ON TrackContentRating.contentRatingID = ContentRating.contentRatingID
WHERE ContentRating.contentRatingName = 'NONE';





#4. Various Join Types

#Inner Join:
SELECT * FROM Tracks INNER JOIN TrackContentRating ON Tracks.TrackID = TrackContentRating.TrackID;

#Left Outer Join:
SELECT * FROM Tracks LEFT JOIN TrackContentRating ON Tracks.TrackID = TrackContentRating.TrackID;

#Right Outer Join:
SELECT * FROM Tracks RIGHT JOIN TrackContentRating ON Tracks.TrackID = TrackContentRating.TrackID;

#Full Join (MySQL does not support FULL JOIN directly, but it can be simulated using UNION):
SELECT * FROM Tracks LEFT JOIN TrackContentRating ON Tracks.TrackID = TrackContentRating.TrackID
UNION
SELECT * FROM Tracks RIGHT JOIN TrackContentRating ON Tracks.TrackID = TrackContentRating.TrackID;


#5. Correlated Subqueries
SELECT TrackName 
FROM Tracks t 
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT * 
    FROM TrackContentRating tc
    JOIN ContentRating cr ON tc.contentRatingID = cr.contentRatingID
    WHERE t.TrackID = tc.TrackID AND cr.contentRatingName = 'EXPLICIT'
);


-- Identify tracks where at least one of the creditors associated with the track does not appear on any other track in the database.
SELECT t.TrackName
FROM Tracks t
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1

        WHERE tc2.CreditorID = tc.CreditorID
        AND tc2.TrackID != t.TrackID
    )
);


#6. Set Operations

#Union:
SELECT TrackName FROM Tracks WHERE ReleaseDate = '2024-01-18'
UNION
SELECT TrackName FROM Tracks WHERE ReleaseDate = '2024-02-09';

#Union equivalence
SELECT DISTINCT TrackName 
FROM Tracks 
WHERE ReleaseDate = '2024-01-18' 
OR ReleaseDate = '2024-02-09';


#Difference (MySQL uses NOT IN or LEFT JOIN ... WHERE IS NULL):
SELECT TrackName FROM Tracks WHERE ReleaseDate = '2024-01-18' AND TrackID NOT IN (SELECT TrackID FROM Tracks WHERE ReleaseDate = '2024-02-09');


#Difference using NOT IN
-- selecting all creditors who are listed as performers and explicitly excluding those who are also listed as producers.
SELECT c.Name
FROM Creditors c
WHERE c.CreditorID IN (SELECT CreditorID FROM Performers)
AND c.CreditorID NOT IN (SELECT CreditorID FROM Producers);

-- selecting all creditors who are listed as performers and explicitly excluding those who are also listed as producers.
#Difference using Left Joinâ€¦ IS NULL
SELECT c.Name
FROM Creditors c
JOIN Performers p ON c.CreditorID = p.CreditorID
LEFT JOIN Producers pr ON c.CreditorID = pr.CreditorID
WHERE pr.CreditorID IS NULL;




#Intersect (MySQL does not support INTERSECT but we wrote it since it is demanded by the question)
-- tracks that have both been trending and have explicit content ratings.
/*SELECT TrackID FROM TrendingDates
INTERSECT
SELECT TrackID FROM TrackContentRating WHERE contentRatingID = (SELECT contentRatingID FROM ContentRating WHERE contentRatingName = 'EXPLICIT');*/


#Intersect equivalence
-- tracks that have both been trending and have explicit content ratings.
SELECT DISTINCT t.TrackID, t.TrackName
FROM Tracks t
JOIN TrendingDates td ON t.TrackID = td.TrackID
JOIN TrackContentRating tcr ON t.TrackID = tcr.TrackID
JOIN ContentRating cr ON tcr.contentRatingID = cr.contentRatingID
WHERE cr.contentRatingName = 'EXPLICIT';





#7. View with Hard-Coded Criteria
CREATE VIEW PGTracks AS 
SELECT Tracks.* 
FROM Tracks 
JOIN TrackContentRating ON Tracks.TrackID = TrackContentRating.TrackID
JOIN ContentRating ON TrackContentRating.contentRatingID = ContentRating.contentRatingID
WHERE ContentRating.contentRatingName = 'EXPLICIT';



#8. Division Operator

#Using NOT IN:
SELECT CreditorID FROM Creditors WHERE CreditorID NOT IN (SELECT CreditorID FROM Performers);

#Using NOT EXISTS:
SELECT CreditorID FROM Creditors c WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Performers p WHERE p.CreditorID = c.CreditorID);




#9.Covering Constraints and Overlap Constraints

#Covering Constraint:

#Overlap Constraints
SELECT

#Another Overlap constraint 
-- Showing overlap by demonstrating that a creditor can belong to multiple subtypes at the same time.
